# Yelp Fusion Code Sample for Node.js

This is a simple script to perform a search on the Yelp Fusion API using an unofficial Node.js client library [tonybadguy/yelp-fusion](https://github.com/tonybadguy/yelp-fusion). This should be compatible with Node.js 4 and higher.

## Setup

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-fusion.git
```

Go into the directory:

```
$ cd yelp-fusion/fusion/node
```

Install the dependences:

```
$ npm install 
```

Open up the `sample.js` file and put your API Key from the [manage app page](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)

```javascript
// Place holder for Yelp Fusion's API Key. Grab them
// from https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app
const apiKey = '<YOUR_API_KEY>';
```

You may optionally update the search request
```javascript
const searchRequest = {
  term:'Four Barrel Coffee',
  location: 'san francisco, ca'
};
```

## Usage

Once you're all setup, you should be able to run the script directly from the command line:

```
$ node sample.js
```

It will print the first business returned:
